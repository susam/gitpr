Introduction
------------
Every project has a main development branch where the developers push
commits on a day-to-day basis. Usually, the main development branch is
`master` but some projects choose to have `develop` or `trunk` or
another branch for day-to-day development activities. We refer to this
main development branch as the *main development branch* throughout this
document to keep the text general. However in the command examples and
ASCII-diagrams, we use `master` as an example of the main development
branch.

We use the following placeholders in the command examples and
ASCII-diagrams in this document:

  - `GITHUB`: [`github.com`](https://github.com/) or domain
    name/hostname of your private GitHub Enterprise system.
  - `USER` or `CONTRIBUTOR`: The user that forks an upstream repository,
    creates pull requests, and sends them to the upstream repository.
  - `UPSTREAM-OWNER`: Owner of the upstream repository. This is the name
    of the user or organization that merges pull requests into the
    upstream repository.
  - `REPO`: Repository name.
  - `FILES`: One or more filenames to be staged for a commit.
  - `TOPIC-BRANCH`: Feature-specific or bug-specific branch where a
    contributor develops her or his contribution. This is referred to as
    the *topic branch* in the text.

These placeholders should be substituted with appropriate values while
executing the commands presented in this document.

Beginners to this workflow should always remember that a Git branch is
not a container of commits, but rather a lightweight moving pointer that
points to a commit in the commit history.

    A---B---C
            ↑
         (master)

When a new commit is made in a branch, its branch pointer simply moves
to point to the last commit in the branch.

    A---B---C---D
                ↑
             (master)

A branch is merely a pointer to the tip of a series of commits. With
this little thing in mind, seemingly complex operations like rebase and
fast-forward merges become easy to understand and use.

The next section, *[Quick Reference](#quick-reference)*, provides a brief
summary of all the frequently used commands involved in creating and merging
pull requests.

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

Quick Reference
---------------
Here is a brief summary of all the commands used to create and merge
pull requests in this document. This section serves as a quick
reference.

    # CREATE PULL REQUEST
    # ===================
    # Fork upstream and clone your fork.
    git clone https://GITHUB/USER/REPO.git
    cd REPO
    git remote add upstream https://GITHUB/UPSTREAM-OWNER/REPO.git
    git remote -v

    # Work on pull request in a new topic branch.
    git checkout -b TOPIC-BRANCH
    git add FILES
    git commit
    git push origin TOPIC-BRANCH

    # Go to your fork on GitHub, switch to the topic branch, and
    # click *Compare & pull request*.

    # Keep your fork's main development branch updated with upstream's.
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout master
    git merge upstream/master
    git push origin master

    # Amend last commit (optional).
    git add FILES
    git commit --amend

    # Rebase topic branch on the main development branch (optional).
    git checkout TOPIC-BRANCH
    git rebase master

    # Edit commits, e.g., last 3 commits in topic branch (optional).
    git checkout TOPIC-BRANCH
    git rebase -i HEAD~3

    # Force push rebased/edited commits to the pull request (optional).
    git push -f origin TOPIC-BRANCH

    # Delete topic branch branch after pull request is merged.
    git checkout master
    git branch -D TOPIC-BRANCH
    git push -d origin TOPIC-BRANCH

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

    # MERGE PULL REQUEST (WITHOUT MERGE COMMIT)
    # =========================================
    # Clone upstream repo.
    git clone https://GITHUB/UPSTREAM-OWNER/REPO.git
    cd REPO

    # Keep the local main development branch up-to-date.
    git checkout master
    git pull

    # Pull changes in pull request into a temporary branch.
    git checkout -b pr
    git pull https://GITHUB/CONTRIBUTOR/REPO.git TOPIC-BRANCH

    # If the above command does not create a new merge commit, ignore
    # this comment and follow the remaining commands after this comment.
    #
    # If the above command creates a new merge commit, choose exactly
    # one of the following three options to get rid of it:
    #
    #   - Request the contributor to rebase the topic branch on the main
    #     development branch. After the contributor has done so, delete
    #     the temporary branch, start over, and pull the changes again.
    #     (Commands: git checkout master; git branch -D pr)
    #
    #   - Go to the pull request page on GitHub, click on the dropdown
    #     menu next to 'Merge pull request', select 'Rebase and merge',
    #     and click 'Rebase and merge'.
    #
    #   - Rebase the topic branch on the main development branch. Then
    #     follow the commands below. Finally close the pull request on
    #     GitHub manually. (Command: git rebase master)

    # Merge pull request and delete temporary branch.
    git checkout master
    git merge pr
    git branch -d pr

    # Push the updated main development branch to upstream repo.
    git push origin master

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

    # MERGE PULL REQUEST (WITH MERGE COMMIT)
    # ======================================
    # Clone upstream repo.
    git clone https://GITHUB/UPSTREAM-OWNER/REPO.git
    cd REPO

    # Keep the local main development branch up-to-date.
    git checkout master
    git pull

    # Pull changes in pull request into a temporary branch.
    git checkout -b pr
    git pull https://GITHUB/CONTRIBUTOR/REPO.git TOPIC-BRANCH

    # Merge pull request and delete temporary branch.
    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff pr
    git branch -d pr

    # Push the updated main development branch to upstream repo.
    git push origin master

The next two sections, *[Create Pull Request](#create-pull-request)*
and *[Merge Pull Request](#merge-pull-request)*, elaborate these
commands in detail.

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

Create Pull Request
-------------------
This section is meant for developers who contribute new commits to the
upstream repository from their personal fork.


### Fork and Clone
On GitHub, fork the upstream repository to your personal user account.

Then clone your fork from your personal GitHub user account to your
local system and set the upstream repository URL as a remote named
`upstream`.

    git clone https://GITHUB/USER/REPO.git
    cd REPO
    git remote add upstream https://GITHUB/UPSTREAM-OWNER/REPO.git
    git remote -v

Now the remote named `upstream` points to the upstream repository and
the remote named `origin` points to your fork.


### Work on Pull Request
Work on a new pull request in a new topic branch and commit it to your
fork. Remember to use a meaningful name instead of `TOPIC-BRANCH` in the
commands below.

    git checkout -b TOPIC-BRANCH
    git add FILES
    git commit
    git push origin TOPIC-BRANCH

Create pull request via GitHub web interface as per the following steps:

  - Go to your fork on GitHub.
  - Switch to the topic branch.
  - Click *Compare & pull request*.
  - Click *Create pull request*.

Wait for an upstream developer to review and merge your pull request.

If there are review comments to be addressed, continue working on your
branch, commiting, optionally rebasing, amending, squashing, and
dropping them, and pushing them to the topic branch of `origin` (your
fork). Any changes to the topic branch automatically become available in
the pull request.

In the fork and pull request workflow, a contributor should never commit
anything to the main development branch of personal fork. This makes it
very easy to keep the main development branch of your fork in sync with
that of the upstream repository. This is explained in the next
subsection.

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

### Keep Your Fork Updated
As new pull requests get merged into the upstream's main development
branch, the main development branch of your fork begins falling behind
it.

The commands below show how to update your fork's main development
branch with the new commits in the upstream's main development branch.

    git fetch upstream
    git checkout master
    git merge upstream/master
    git push origin master

The `git merge` command above simply fast-forwards the main development
branch from an earlier commit to the last commit in the upstream's main
development branch.

When your main development branch falls behind the upstream's main
development branch, the upstream's main development branch extends
linearly from the last commit in your main development branch, provided
that there are no additional commits to your main development branch
that has caused it to diverge.

                  E---F---G  (TOPIC-BRANCH)
                 /
    A---B---C---D  (master)
                 \
                  H---I---J  (upstream/master)


With such a commit history, when the upstream's main development branch
is merged into your main development branch, the merge is done by simply
fast-forwarding the pointer of your main development branch to the last
commit in the upstream's main development branch.

                  E---F---G  (TOPIC-BRANCH)
                 /
    A---B---C---D
                 \
                  H---I---J  (upstream/master, master)

After the merge is complete, the upstream's main development branch and
your main development branch point to the same commit.

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

### Amend Last Commit
This is an optional step to rework on the last commit. After commiting
some work, one may realize that some files need to be modified or the
commit message needs to updated.

         E---F---G  (TOPIC-BRANCH)
        /
    A---B---C---D   (master)

Git allows us to pick the last commit, modify the changes made in that
commit including the commit message, and reapply the changes along with
the modifications as a new commit that replaces the last commit.

         E---F---G' (TOPIC-BRANCH)
        /
    A---B---C---D   (master)

To do so, first rework on the files and make the necessary changes. Then
add, remove, move, or rename files to stage them for commiting. Finally,
amend the last commit. The commit message may be modified when the
editor comes up to show the commit message.

    git add FILES
    git commit --amend

Although the above example shows only the `git add` command to add new
or modified files for commiting, one may amend the last commit by
removing, moving, and renaming files with the `git rm` and `git mv`
commands before amending the last commit.

To update only the commit message without changing files, run only `git
commit --amend`.


### Rebase Commits
This is an optional step to keep the commit history as linear as possible.

The main development branch may have diverged since the topic branch was
created.

         E---F---G (TOPIC-BRANCH)
        /
    A---B---C---D  (master)

It may be a good idea to move the commits in the topic branch and place
them on top of the main development branch, so that the topic branch
extends linearly from the last commit in the main development branch.

                  E'--F'--G' (TOPIC-BRANCH)
                 /
    A---B---C---D  (master)

The following commands show how to rebase the topic branch on the main
development branch.

    git checkout TOPIC-BRANCH
    git rebase master


### Edit Commits
This is an optional step to keep the commit history clean and concise.

A pull request may contain multiple commits. Sometimes one may need to
amend a commit that is not the last commit in the pull request. Commits
prior to the last commit can be amended with the interactive rebase
command.

After developing the required feature or bug-fix in a topic branch, the
developer or a reviewer may notice issues in the work that need to be
addressed before the pull request can be merged into the upstream
repository. This may lead to multiple new commits in the topic branch
that should ideally have been part of the first commit that implemented
that feature or bug-fix.

         E---F---G (TOPIC-BRANCH)
        /
    A---B---C---D  (master)

In such cases, it may be a good idea to squash multiple commits in the
topic branch into a single coherent commit with all changes for the
feature or bug-fix being developed.

         E'        (TOPIC-BRANCH)
        /
    A---B---C---D  (master)

The following example shows how to amend the last 3 commits.

    git checkout TOPIC-BRANCH
    git rebase -i HEAD~3

This brings up an editor with three lines for the last 3 commits ordered
from earliest to last followed by instructions on how to edit these
lines to amend the commits.

For example, to squash all three commits into one, leave the first
commit untouched, replace `pick` with `squash` in the next two lines,
save, and quit the editor. This brings up the editor again. Clean up the
commit message, save, and quit the editor.

Apart from `pick` and `squash`, there are other operations such as
`reword`, `edit`, `drop`, etc. to amend or drop commits. Follow the
instructions that appear in the editor to use them. When a rebase
operation involves multiple steps, Git walks you through each step by
offering suggestions and commands that you need to use in each step.

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

### Force Push
The steps in the last three sections overwrite the history of the
branch. If these steps are performed after the pull request branch has
already been pushed to GitHub, then it is necessary to use the `-f` or
`--force` option to push the overwritten history to GitHub.

    git push -f origin TOPIC-BRANCH

The `-f` (force) option in the `git push` command is necessary only if
you are pushing to an already existing pull request branch because doing
so overwrites the history of the branch. Normally, overwriting history
is strictly discouraged but this is one of the rare scenarios where it
is safe to overwrite the commit history because the commits are being
pushed to a personal branch in a personal fork without affecting the
upstream repository.


### Delete Branch
Once the upstream developer merges your pull request, you may delete the
topic branch from your local system as well as from your fork.

    git checkout master
    git branch -D TOPIC-BRANCH
    git push -d origin TOPIC-BRANCH

The next section, *[Merge Pull Request](#merge-pull-request)*, explains how an
upstream owner can merge pull request from contributors into the upstream
repository.

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

Merge Pull Request
------------------
This section is meant for lead developers who own the upstream
repository and merge pull requests from contributors to it.

There are two popular methods to merge commits: one that does not
introduce an additional merge commit, and another that does. Both are
perfectly acceptable. Both are discussed below.

Which method you choose depends on whether you want to maintain a
concise commit history consisting only of development commits or if you
want to introduce additional merge commits for every merge into your
commit history.


### Without Merge Commit
Clone the upstream repository to your local system.

    git clone https://GITHUB/UPSTREAM-OWNER/REPO.git
    cd REPO

If the repository was already cloned to the local system earlier, then
ensure that the local main development branch is up-to-date with that in
the upstream repository.

    git checkout master
    git pull

Create a temporary branch (`pr` for example) to pull the contribution
(pull request) from the CONTRIBUTOR's branch in it.

    git checkout -b pr
    git pull https://GITHUB/CONTRIBUTOR/REPO.git TOPIC-BRANCH

If the contributor adds new commits to the pull request later, then run
these commands again to pull the new commits.

If the main development branch has diverged from the branch in the pull
request, the above command creates a new merge commit to merge the pull
request into the temporary branch. There are three possible options to
get rid of this additional merge commit:

  - Request the contributor to rebase the topic branch on the main
    development branch. See the *[Rebase Commits](#rebase-commits)*
    section for more details. After the contributor has rebased the
    topic branch on the main development branch, delete the temporary
    branch.

        git checkout master
        git branch -D pr

    Then start over and pull the pull request again. In fact, if at any
    time the contributor rebases the pull request, or edits, squashes,
    amends, or drops commits in the pull request, delete the temporary
    branch and start over, and pull the pull request again.

  - Go to the pull request page on GitHub, click on the dropdown menu
    next to the *Merge pull request* button, select *Rebase and merge*,
    and click *Rebase and merge*.

    Caveat: The rebase operation rewrites the commit history of the pull
    request submitted by the contributor. As a result, it modifies the
    commit hash, committer, and commit date of each change in the pull
    request. The committer and commit date fields are separate from the
    author and author date fields. Use `git log --format=fuller` to see
    all four fields.

    This caveat is usually not a major problem because the author and
    author date still remain intact. Further since the rebase and merge
    is done via GitHub, it closes the pull request successfully and sets
    its status to *Merged*.

    However if you are not comfortable with the committer details
    changing, then do not choose this option and choose the previous
    option instead.

  - Rebase the pull request on the main development branch as explained
    in the *[Rebase Commits](#rebase-commits)* section.

    Caveat: In addition to the caveat mentioned in the previous point,
    in this case, GitHub remains oblivious of the changed commit hashes
    because the rebase operation is done locally, not via GitHub.
    Therefore after the merged pull request is pushed to the upstream
    repository, GitHub does not close the pull request.

    The pull request on GitHub can then be closed manually but its
    status would appear as *Merged*. It would appear as *Closed*
    instead. This can be confusing and misleading. Therefore this option
    is not recommended. Choose one of the previous two options instead.

After sufficient testing, merge the commits in the pull request into the
main development branch and remove the pull request branch.

    git checkout master
    git merge pr
    git branch -d pr

Finally, push the current state of the main development branch to the
upstream repository.

    git push origin master

The `git merge` command above simply fast-forwards the main development
branch from an earlier commit to the last commit in the pull request
thereby making both the main development branch and the pull request
branch point to the same commit. This achieves the merge from the pull
request branch into the main development branch without creating a new
merge commit.

After a pull request branch is rebased on the main development branch,
the pull request branch becomes a linear extension of the main
development branch.

                  E'---F'---G' (pr)
                 /
    A---B---C---D (master)

With such a commit history, when the pull request branch is now merged
into the main development branch, the merge is done by simply
fast-forwarding the pointer of the main development branch to the last
commit in the pull request branch.

                  E'---F'---G' (pr, master)
                 /
    A---B---C---D

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

### With Merge Commit
Clone the upstream repository to your local system.

    git clone https://GITHUB/UPSTREAM-OWNER/REPO.git
    cd REPO

If the repository was already cloned to the local system earlier, then
ensure that the local main development branch is up-to-date with that in
the upstream repository.

    git checkout
    git pull

Create a temporary branch (`pr` for example) to pull the contribution
(pull request) from the CONTRIBUTOR's branch in it.

    git checkout -b pr
    git pull https://GITHUB/CONTRIBUTOR/REPO.git TOPIC-BRANCH

If the contributor adds new commits to the pull request later, then run
these commands again to pull the new commits.

After sufficient testing, merge the commits in the pull request into the
main development branch.

    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff pr
    git branch -d pr

Finally, push the current state of the main development branch (with the
commits from the pull request in it) to the upstream repository.

    git push origin master

The `--no-ff` (no fast-forward) option in the `git merge` command
ensures that a merge commit is always created even when a fast-forward
merge is possible.

                  E'---F'---G' (pr)
                 /           \
    A---B---C---D-------------H (master)

Nifty Commands
--------------
This is a bonus section that describes a few aliases and commands that
may be useful during day-to-day development activities.


### Pretty Logs
The following commands create aliases to run `git log` with various subsets of
{`--pretty`, `--graph`, `--all`} options to display commit logs in a compact
form, i.e., one line per log.

    # Define aliases.
    FORMAT="%C(auto)%h %C(magenta)%ad %C(cyan)%an%C(auto)%d %s"
    PRETTY="--pretty=format:'$FORMAT' --date=short"
    git config --global alias.lga "log --graph --all $PRETTY"
    git config --global alias.lg "log --graph $PRETTY"
    git config --global alias.la "log --all $PRETTY"
    git config --global alias.ll "log $PRETTY"
    git config --global alias.lf "log --pretty=fuller --stat"

    # Use aliases.
    git lga
    git lg
    git la
    git ll
    git lf


### Staged Changes
While `git diff` shows the unstaged changes in the working directory, it
is necessary to use the `--cached` option with `git diff` to see the
changes staged for the next commit. The following commands create
convenient aliases for this option.

    # Define aliases.
    git config --global alias.diffc "diff --cached"
    git config --global alias.dc "diff --cached"

    # Use aliases.
    git diffc
    git dc

<!-- :: \pagebreak -->

### Branch Listing
The following commands provides aliases to list branches with verbose
information. The second alias includes remote branches too in the
output.

    # Define aliases.
    git config --global alias.br "branch -vv"
    git config --global alias.brr "branch -vva"

    # Use aliases.
    git br
    git brr


### More Aliases
Here are a few more commands to define aliases for very frequently used
commands.

    # Define aliases.
    git config --global alias.co "checkout"
    git config --global alias.cob "checkout -b"
    git config --global alias.ca "commit --amend"

    # Use aliases.
    git co
    git cob
    git ca


### Find Merge Base
Find a common ancestor of two branches with this command. It helps to
find the commit after which two branches began diverging.

    git merge-base upstream/master TOPIC-BRANCH


### Add Changes Interactively
Sometimes when you are in the zone, you may make large sweeping changes
to a file. However it is a good practice to create separate and small
commits for separate concerns. To select some changes in a file while
ignoring other changes in the same file for the next commit, stage the
changes interactively with this command.

    git add -p

This command shows every change hunk one by one. Enter `y` to stage a
hunk for the next commit, `n` to ignore it, and `s` to split the hunk
into multiple smaller hunks. Enter `?` to print help message about each
interactive option that can be entered.


### Some Git Wisdom
Enter one of the commands below in your command shell depending on your
operating system, or just open the URL with your web browser.
